Thia was the first time any of us have ever coded in C# before, or used Unity in general. It was really difficult trying to code in a new language while also learning how to make a game. We learned a lot about the syntax of C# and found that many of the concepts we learned in Python translated to other languages as well. At first it was very difficult adapting to a syntax that didn't read as English as much as Python's syntax does. We also learned a lot about Unity itself. We learned how to create and add animations in our game, how to write code so that an animation only starts when something triggers it, and more. We really enjoyed making some pixel art. Mario was especially fun to draw. We had a lot of fun with drawing the main menu. We learned that we could write a function inside a script, then apply that speciifc function to any object we wanted to. 

While coding, we encountered a lot of problems. We used Youtube tutorials to learn how to write code for certain behaviors and functions. But there were certain things we wanted to do that a tutorial couldn't completely explain. We adapted by observing the code and how it works from tutorials, then reforming and reapplying them to new objects. For example, we wanted to have a script that could quickly change from one scene to the next. We learned how to load in scenes by understanding what the code from the tutorials actually meant. That way we were easily able to code some things on our own. 

We had no idea how difficult it could be to make a game. Turns out it's extremely difficult. As a result we were unable to fulfill our original vision. It was extremely time consuming to make just a few pixel assets, so we opted for free assets off the Unity store. We couldn't translate the ideas in our head to the game, so we would come up with new and more realistic ideas as we got further along with learning how Unity works as beginners.
